    SUPERVISOR: Jesus Alonso Zarate

 
The work will consist in:

	1) Learning OpenWSN.
	2) Learning existing DQ implementation in OpenMotes.
	3) Migrating DQ to OpenWSN.
	4) Run OpenWSN with DQ at the MAC layer on an OpenMote and deploy a simple network to exchange sensor data and show it on a computer.
	5) Evaluate the performance of a network running DQ and compare it with the performance of a network running IEEE 802.15.4e already available in OpenWSN.
	6) Migrate the implementation of DQ in OpenWSN from OpenMotes to a platform with LoRaWAN radio.
	7) Write a final report.
	8) Write a technical paper for a conference/journal.
